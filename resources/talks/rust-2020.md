# Build linux kernel modules with rust for fun

## Abstract

One of the biggest advantages of rust for building mission-critical software is its performance and memory-safety. In this talk, I'll compare the differences of writing kernel modules between C and rust. And do small live demos to illustrate how much fun we could gain in writing kernel modules with rust. One of the demos will be written from scratch and the rest will be using `fishinabarrel/linux-kernel-module-rust`.

## Details

intended audience: advanced programmers that have certain kernel knowledge
outline:

1. a short intro to kernel module and the reason memory safety is important
2. kernel module written in C - the old way
3. kernel module written in rust - the safe way
4. comparison of two approaches
5. small and fun kernel module demos
6. dos and don'ts

## Pitch

Rust could be used in lots of areas from the very low-level system programming to high-level app development. I have many years of networking and kernel-related programming (router, firewall, etc.) and feel that how fabulous if we could have rust 10 years ago. Though I just learned rust half a year ago, I was obsessed with it and wrote several pet projects, as well as using it to build erlang NIF. I previously delivered 2 talks in code-beam conf (for erlang/elixir) so I'd like to try to engage more with the rust world.

## Speaker Info

Tian Chen has over fifteen years of experience working in the software industry. He currently works at ArcBlock as VP of Engineering. Tian is a polyglot, his day-to-day languages are elixir / nodejs / rust / python. He loves the beauty of memory models of rust and the concept of zero-cost abstraction, and is using rust for extending the capability of Erlang VM and some pet projects.
