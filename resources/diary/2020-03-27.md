# Tubi Intro

So excited to be back in the Tubi family! I worked here in 2015-2018 with very good memories. For those who have not met me in person - I have two lovely daughters, Lindsey(7) and Rosie(3). Lindsey is good at math and Rosie loves dinosaurs. Both girls would occasionally rush to my room, making faces and meowing when I'm doing zoom meetings. Don't be scared :)

My favorite sport is kind of boring - it's running. When I was at Tubi, (almost) every other noon I'll run along California St. (or Mission St.) all the way down to the Embarcadaro, and then run with beautiful scenery along the way to Fisherman's Wharf. This granted me a good foundation to do marathons. I attended several full marathons, and last year in the Portland marathon, I had the best-ever-had experience: in my last 500m, Lindsey joined me and we finished together.

That's pretty much about me. Looking forward to working with all of you!
